# SabrinaHuajy-Password-Generator

Hereby I present an application that an employee can freely use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected.

This Password Generator has been generated as a fun Intermediate JavaScript challenge.

This app was created to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. My app has a relatively clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that itself adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The following screenshot images illustrated the web application's appearance and functionality:

1) Length of password, which would be at least 10 characters but no more than 64.

<br>
2) Whether or not to include any of the 4 character types, which are: Lowercase; Uppercase; Numeric and Special characters ($@%&*, etc.).
